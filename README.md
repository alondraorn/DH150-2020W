# Monterey Park Community Library by Vicki Truong

## Introduction:  
The Monterey Park Community Library is a project intended to encourage library participation by removing the hassle from using library websites. Libraries are places where people can come together and interact, but also places where people can enhance their own learning. People of all ages can benefit from community libraries. Approaching this project from a user experience standpoint is important to help users have an easier time, and many features have users in mind. 

## Clear design statement: 
Libraries are important beacons for community development. Libraries provide free and open access to various resources that will satisfy the educational, informational, and cultural needs of users. Difficult library website interfaces can dissuade users from returning to libraries. After evaluation of other websites, shortcomings can be gauged so this project can be as satisfying, accessible, and as efficient as possible. By offering a library website that will improve user satisfaction, users are encouraged to gather at libraries to foster community and enhance their learning. 

## Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation
I evaluated the Alhambra Civic Center Library and the Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library websites. I chose these websites because I frequented these libraries as a child. I followed Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems and their severity. For the Alhambra Library website, I felt that there were some issues with clarity and finding help. For the Monterey Park Library website, I felt there were some issues with consistency in labelling which can confuse users, as well as a lack of an easily accessible contact page.

## Competitor Analysis: Usability Testing
For Usability Testing, I had a user test out the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/). I asked a user to complete three tasks on the library website: 1) find a book using keyword (using filter features), 2) find a book using subject and 3) find library contact information. During this pilot test, the test user was able to finish all three tasks. I tried to organize tasks 1 and 2 to compare the keyword and subject search features, and the test user finished the first two with relative ease, but had some trouble with the third. The user had the same difficulty that I did when trying to find the contact information, but gave up relatively earlier than I did before trying again.

### User Research: Contextual Inquiry  
In the practice of contextual inquiries, users are the ones working through the project and the interviewers use open ended questions to understand the users. I asked a user to work through three objectives: to complete a search, find a library event, and obtain library information (hours, address, contact), but allowed the user to work through the website on their own and encouraged the user to talk aloud. I would ask the user questions from my contextual inquiry script. 
In the end, I managed to learn the user's motivations for going to libraries and using library websites, which was to enhance the user's academic research and make future library trips more convenient. I was able to see what the user would want from the website and the user's difficulties while also mentally comparing how I went through the tasks.

## UX storytelling: Personas + Scenarios
Personas are archetypical users whose goals and personality characteristics represent the needs of target users of the design. Each persona has an empathy map, which is a visualization used to articulate what a user says, thinks, does, feels, and works towards. Scenarios define when, where, and how the story of the persona takes place. It tracks the behavior and thoughts of the user as a sequence of events (journey map). I created three personas and scenarios based on target users of the library website and gave them each empathy maps, scenarios, and journey maps. Each user has a specific goal and improved features of the library website can help them achieve them.

| Example Scenario | 
| -----------| 
| Kevin is an elementary school student who loves to watch movies with his parents. He has recently watched the first Harry Potter film and wants to read the Harry Potter books. He goes to the library with his parents to search for the first Harry Potter book. He misspells Harry Potter as Hairy Potter, but he does not catch his own mistake. Since it is spelled wrong, he doesnâ€™t obtain any search results, but Kevin is confused. He has to ask his father to help him with the search and they check out the first book together. Kevin comes back two weeks later after finishing the book, and this time, the library has remodeled the catalog. Kevin makes a search and is surprised to see that there is now a dropdown of suggested searches as he types into the search bar. He recognizes the title as opposed to having to spell it correctly and can easily click on the book title. Kevin feels this is much easier and is eager to return to the library again. |

## High-Fidelity Prototype: Functional/Interactive prototype 
From the low-fidelity prototype to the high-fidelity prototype, I made several changes. I added many more frames and more features, so that tasks were better lined out. For example, I included login steps, contact pages, help pages, reserving a book instead of bookmarking it, and a section on managing reserved books. This is why my high-fidelity prototype looks different from my low-fidelity prototype. I also tried to take graphical interface design and accessibility into account. 

The overarching main task is searching for a book using the library website. In this prototype, the tasks are presented in a flow-like sequence.  
The tasks embedded within this main task that are found in the prototype are:  
A) Finding the contact information and using the message center.  
B) Log in to your library account.  
C) Using the help center page as a guide for forming search queries.  
D) Search for a harry potter book using the field limit of your option (there is also autosuggestion)  
- i) Refine the search 
- ii) Reserve or bookmark a book.  

E) Manage your account.
- i) Renew books.

## Optional Evaluation and Revision History 

#### Assignment 7 (Low-Fidelity Prototype Revision)
I roughly resketched my low-fidelity prototype with some more features after receiving feedback from my first one.

#### Assignment 8 (High-Fidelity Prototype Revision)
Within the high-fidelity prototype, I received peer feedback, so I updated my high-fidelity prototype before submission. From the user feedback, they felt that the bookmark and reserve buttons were too crowded, the color scheme could be a little less flat, and the contact pages seemed confusing at the end. I first changed the bookmark and reserve buttons to links. The buttons were clunky and I could achieve a similar effect but in a neater way. The color contrast also was not good, so by changing the buttons to underlined text, users received it better. I also added some accents of blue to break up all the orange and brown, and I feel that the blue goes well with these colors. Finally, I moved the contact slides to the beginning, since the user felt that the end of the search should be the end of the prototype. After my own review, I adjusted the name and the home page to better reflect the purpose of the website and the theme of the project (community).

#### Accessibility Audit

I ran the accessibility audit on a few slides. The only aspect that failed the audit was the "share" button, but that is a part of InVision, not a part of the prototype. Otherwise, the contrast ratio seems good.

## Pitch Video 

## Conclusion: What did you learn throughout the process?

I am glad I got to experience the steps of user experience design from beginning to end. By breaking up the steps into weekly  assignments, I was able to study the theory behind the assignment and apply it. I took the theory along with my own observations from the heuristic evaluations to build a prototype that I feel addresses many of the issues that I saw. I learned that user experience design is not always linear. I was always editing my work as I went because I wanted to approach things from a user perspective as much as possible. I also received feedback from peers (usability testing, contextual inquiry, prototype feedback), which led me to re-evaluate things and fix them as needed. Even with a "finished" product, there can always be more feedback to better usability and utility. I enjoyed getting familiar with different applications such as Invision Studio and Brackets because the tasks reinforced user experience principles as I did them. Overall, this process taught me a lot about how to implement the user experience design process.
