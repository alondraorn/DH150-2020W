# Interviewing People in Context
## DH 150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry (User Study) by Vicki Truong

#### Description of project design challenge, target users, research method(s)
The website we are working with is the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/).  
One of main functions of the website is to be able to complete searches for books and resources. Most library websites have a catalog to complete these functions, but it can be improved for optimal user satisfaction.  
Target users include any user of a library who may want to find a resource, particularly younger children, high school students, higher education students, and adults who do general reading.  
The main challenge at hand is to find a book in the library catalog and to obtain basic library information (address, library, etc.). The value of the experience is that users should be able to efficiently obtain resources without hassles. The library is a place to foster community and feel peaceful, so the catalog should not hinder a user's experience.  
The interview will be a participatory observation and take place in a quiet residence hall. I have asked a fellow college student because I feel that students are part of the target users. I will use my laptop to video record and take notes on paper. I will observe how the participant navigates through the task and encourage them to speak aloud.
