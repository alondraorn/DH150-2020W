# Interviewing People in Context
## DH 150 Assignment 4: Contextual Inquiry (User Study) by Vicki Truong

#### Description of project design challenge, target users, research method(s)

The website we are working with is the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/).  
One of main functions of the website is to be able to complete searches for books and resources. Most library websites have a catalog to complete these functions, but it can be improved for optimal user satisfaction.  
Target users include any user of a library who may want to find a resource, particularly younger children, high school students, higher education students, and adults who do general reading.  
The main challenges at hand are to find a book in the library catalog, find a library event, and to obtain basic library information (address, library, etc.). The value of the experience is that users should be able to efficiently obtain resources to enhance their own learning without hassles. The library is a place to foster community and feel peaceful, so the catalog should not hinder a user's experience.  
The interview will be a participatory observation and take place in a quiet residence hall. I have asked a fellow college student because I feel that students are part of the target users. I will use my laptop to video record and take notes on paper. I will observe how the participant navigates through the task and encourage them to speak aloud.

As an aside, I apologize for the noises when typing occurs and the loud whirring from the laptop. I don't know of a way around this, especially because the video recording software causes the laptop fan to turn on. Please let me know if there are any issues accessing the material.

#### Short reflection on what you learned and what you will do differently in the future.

In the future, I would avoid using the same person from the UT testing. However, given the time frame I wanted to complete the assignment in, the few people who were willing to be on camera, and schedule differences, it was not easy for me to find someone else. However, it has been about two weeks since the UT and the tasks are not exactly the same. I was still able to gain insight from this contextual inquiry. By making the tasks more freeform and having more discussion questions planned than in the UT, I felt that discussion flowed well and the user could explain himself.  
The user faced some of the same user experience issues that I ran into during my own testing of the website and the heuristic evaluation. The fact that some features link externally in new windows was rather bothersome, and there was a lot of redundancy in the links which got confusing.  
I was a bit surprised when the user did not try to refine the search on his own will when searching for orbital mechanical books. I would have tried many different ways (such as using subject or title as the searchword criteria instead of just keyword). However, this is the why being able to place myself in a different perspective is important, because not every user is going to be the same, and not every user is going to go to the lengths that I do to find something. It had me thinking: does it boil down to personality? experience with the website? lack of documentation readily available on the website? or a mixture of all of them?  
In the end, I managed to learn the user's motivations for going to libraries and using library websites, which was to enhance the user's academic research and make future library trips more convenient. I also got to see the user's difficulties and what the user would want from the website.  
Something that I would like to improve is that I could improve my moderating skills. Sometimes I inadvertently confirm things when the user asks me if they are doing something right, but it is a bit reflexive. Also, the user asked me what I thought about the website at the very end, which kind of took me aback because I wasn't sure if I should give my opinion, but I did remind them that I am not the designer, but rather seeking to improve user experience.
