# Library Communities
## DH150 Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation by Vicki Truong

To me, the idea of community is rooted in bringing people together, so both of my websites are related to the public libraries that I would frequent as a child. I chose these websites because libraries offer valuable community resources for free, such as books, internet access, and homework help. 
People can connect over their newfound knowledge, thus fostering community. The first website is the website for the Alhambra Civic Center Library, which I frequently used growing up to search for new books to read. The second website is the website for the Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library, which I also used to frequent. 
By improving the UX design of these sites, I can help users more readily access community resources that they can be a part of.

#### Website 1: Alhambra Civic Center Library Website 
https://alhambralibrary.org/  
The Alhambra Civic Center Library website begins on a home page where you can navigate to the catalog portal. The website has its main offerings on the heading bar: about the library, events, children's, teens, collections, services, and accounts. The website does seem well organized, but I would have expected the catalog button to be more prominent. To me, it seems like it gets lost in the top right corner and in the middle of the page. I feel like the catalog is fairly easy to navigate. The thing that stuck out to me the most was the color coding that symbolized the availability status of the catalog item. 

#### Website 2: Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library Website
http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/  
The Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website is centered around its catalog, with additional categories at the header (my library, help topics, library, eBook, library calendar/events, Worldcat, and featured items list). Some of the categories link to a different part of the general Monterey Park website. At first glance, it seems plainer than the Alhambra Library website, with less information on screen at a time. The catalog function is less visually impactful than the Alhambra Library website, and the circulation availability does not stand out very well. 

## Heuristic Evaluation Severity Scale
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority   
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority   

## Website 1 Heuristic Evaluation (Alhambra Civic Center Library)

### 1. Visibility of system status
\- Some of the links turn a different color when you hover over them, but some of them do not. By having consistency in the way links react to be hovered over, it gives users a clearer idea of what they are about to interact with. **(1)**  
\- After creating a search in the catalog, the results are a continuous scroll, so it can be harder to tell where in the results you are. **(1)**  
\- In the catalog, after making a search, you can further refine the results to filter through them. However, after selecting the criteria for refining a search, it automatically updates, but it would be nice to have a "Done" popup or have a progress bar because the change might not be obvious enough. **(2)**   

Visibility of system status is important to inform users about what is going on. Overall, this heuristic is not a big issue for this website. There is even a loading bar with progress percentage when searching in the catalog, which is a nice touch. Also, after clicking on a subcategory, the website displays what category the subcategory falls under so users can navigate there.  

### 2. Match between system and the real world
\- The search bar in the top right has three options to search through: catalog, database, and site. However, the difference between catalog and database is not immediately apparent based on their similar textbook definitions. The definitions that the website uses are in the middle of the home page after scrolling further down, but I missed them the first few times I was on the website because there is not enough contrast in the definitions section to stand out. **(2)**  
\- After making a search in the catalog, there are two "search" related options on the screen: more search options and refine search. I feel that refine search seems self-explanatory, but "more search options" seems more vague. It turns out that more search options is another way of filtering search results but in a different method. **(2)**  
\- In the header, the "My Account" link takes me to the catalog website, so I would have expected it to be labelled Catalog/Account or along those lines. **(2)**  

Otherwise, the website has conventions that are not too specific and can be used by many.  

### 3. User control and freedom
\- In the catalog, I expected the "clear" button next to the search bar to clear the contents of the search bar. Instead, it completely moved away from the current search I was on and automatically brought me back to the front of the catalog page which I was not expecting. I feel like this can fall under both heuristic 3 and 4 because it is a matter of standard language usage (clear does not usually relink to a different page in my experience) and exiting when not desired. **(2)**  

There does not seem to be major issues with user control and freedom. The website responds to basic commands like the back arrow button or swiping left to go back to previous pages, the X button to terminate loading, and Control+Z to undo typing commands. During search refinements in the catalog, you can remove a refinement as needed by simply clicking the x.  

### 4. Consistency and standards
\- In the dropdown menu, subcategories are preceded by a small triangle that is pointing to the right. It leads me to believe that there is more that will appear when I hover over the triangle because that is what I associate the triangle with (right indicating go), but nothing else drops down. **(2)**   

I feel that the website and catalog have fairly standard conventions. Headers help guide to different site categories and at the bottom there is common information such as business hours. There is a magnifying glass next to search bars and other common convention symbols that correspond to their text. 

### 5. Error prevention
\- On the homepage, when I click on the search bar in the top right corner, it provides me with a dropdown options list of previous searches that I have typed into that bar. However, for the login information in the catalog website, it provides a dropdown associated with all of the usernames/emails that Google Chrome (my internet browser) has saved. I wouldn't have expected there to be default options in the login information because I feel that it could be sensitive information that should be retyped every time. Normally, possible options are given to prevent errors but this seemed cluttered. I'm not sure why it links to my previous non-library related searches, but I understand that this could be more of a Internet browser related issue. **(2)**  
\- If I make a typo when creating a search in the catalog or home page, there aren't auto-suggestions to signal to me that I am not on the right track. The search bars are mainly free form. **(2)**  

As mentioned under heuristic 9, the system is able to catch some invalid entries in the catalog website. There are also some fields that have built in dropdown options so users can choose what option they feel fits best.  

### 6. Recognition rather than recall
\- I like the dropdown options from the header on the homepage, but I wish that the header stayed at the top when I scroll down because I could more easily access other components instead of scrolling all the way up. **(1)**   

Despite the header not staying at the top on the homepage, the search header bar on the catalog page does stay on top while I scroll up and down. 

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
\- The refine search button on the catalog is not very big and seems obscure on the left side of the screen. It almost runs into the search results and many users may miss it altogether. **(2)**  
\- In the events page on the website, the only way to navigate between months is a previous and next button. It would be more efficient to have a feature that can allow you to navigate between all of the months in a dropdown menu or something along those lines. **(2)**  

Otherwise, navigation keys and shortcuts appear to work fine on this website. 

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
\- The slideshow-esque feature on the homepage could be just a hair smaller in my opinion to allow other resources to shine, but it is not a big issue. At the time of writing, the second slide is in Chinese, but I am not sure if it is meant for only Chinese speakers, and there is no immediate English translation. **(1)**  

The aesthetic seems fairly clean and kid-friendly overall. Something that I do like is that when I click on a book listing, a text box becomes integrated in the page to keep the flow continuous rather than open an external page. It still gives you the option to use a permalink to open an external page. 

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
\- If I type in some random text in the URL after the existing https://alhambralibrary.org, I see a plain 404 Not Found error page. This is not the most descriptive 404 error. Maybe it can suggest possible errors the user made when typing an address in or explaining that this URL does not exist in the site. **(3)**  

Despite this, the system did catch when I tried to input an invalid form of card number and pin/phone number in the catalog website. It told me that I could only use previous secure passwords and the phone number had to have ten digits. It also told me to input terms when I left the catalog search term blank and the login information blank. 

### 10. Help and documentation
\- In the upper right side of the catalog, there is a space to log in to your Alhambra Civic Center Library account. However, there is no "Forgot Your Password?" button that is a common convention, though this may be because kids might not have recovery emails. Nevertheless, it is something that I noticed. There is a phone number to call if one forgets their login information but the little popup with this information is not consistently on the screen because it appears once you click to input login text but can disappear easily. I feel like it should be a fixture. **(3)**  
\- In the homepage, there's no FAQ page, which I expected to be under the information tab, on its own in the header, or in the footer. Upon further examination, I think there is no general FAQ page because there are so many sections to a library that a FAQ page may be too broad. I do see that there are some subcategories that mention FAQs, but these are more specific. **(1)**  

The Help button in the catalog is much easier to find and is clearly labelled along with a question mark symbol. It helps with formatting search queries. There is contact information throughout the website in case one has an inquiry. 

Website 1 has its merits, though there are still some features that can be worked on to better  user experience. More notably, I feel addressing the difference between catalog and database more clearly, the uninformative 404 error page, and the lack of a permanent forgot your password pop up box can improve this website. 

## Website 2 Heuristic Evaluation (Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library)

### 1. Visibility of system status
\- There isn’t a way of gauging the progress of a search in the library catalog, which could be helpful because these searches can take a while if there are a lot of search results. **(2)**  
\- The circulation availability is not very prominent because it is just a line of text without any contrasting color or size. There should be a better way to know (possibly through color coding).  **(2)**  

The website does generally indicate to you what you are about to interact with through highlighting/color changes and you can readily tell what page of search results you are on. 

### 2. Match between system and the real world
\- I would expect a contact bar or more information to be in the top right or on the bottom of the page, but it is missing. **(2)**  

There isn’t a lot of specific jargon, so the website is fairly readable. 

### 3. User control and freedom

The website does respond to basic user controls. During catalog searches, users can refine their searches but they can also remove any constraints they had previously specified.  

### 4. Consistency and standards
\- In the header, there is a section called help center but in the upper right of the page, there is a section called help. Both of them link to the same help page. The inconsistency in labeling causes confusion because it makes it seem like they refer to different things. **(2)**  
\- On the other hand, in the header, there are two sections called “my library” and “library” but they do not refer to the same thing. My library includes a dropdown menu with account login, library information, purchase suggestions, and comments. Library simply links to part of the general Monterey Park website that has contact information. There should be a distinction between the labels. **(2)**  

### 5. Error prevention
\- If I make a typo when creating a search in the catalog or home page, there aren't auto-suggestions to signal to me that I am not on the right track. The search bars are mainly free form. **(2)**  

The website helps prevent some errors by providing predetermined options in some forms. 

### 6. Recognition rather than recall
\- In the header, it would promote recognition to indicate which sections have dropdowns under them so the user does not have to hover over all of them to see which sections have subsections available. **(2)**  
\- Currently, the header does not stay at the top when the user scrolls down. It would be nice to have the header stay at the top at all times for easy access so the user does not have to scroll up again. Thus, the user can become more familiar with what sections are available. **(2)**  

### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use

\- After forming a search in the catalog, when you click on a search result, it replaces the current page with the new link. To keep the integrity of the original search, the new link could open in a new window. **(2)**  

Otherwise, navigation keys and shortcuts appear to work fine on this website. 

### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design

The design is plain and could be more inviting. The actual content of the website is not very cluttered because there isn’t much on a page at a time and there are external links. 

### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
\- The 404 error message page is not very descriptive (The requested URL was not found on this server.) **(2)**  
\- When I make an empty search, the website does not tell me that I should have entered text in. Instead, it just refreshes the page, which does not help the user diagnose the problem. **(3)**  

### 10. Help and documentation
\- There is help documentation available for catalog searches, but the contact information for the actual library is not labelled directly on the catalog website. In order to reach the library contact information, one would navigate to the “library” section of the header, but “library” can be an ambiguous term. **(2)**  

As mentioned in heuristic 4, there is a help page available but the links leading to it are a little misleading. There are search help tips when using the catalog and a space for comments and suggestions. 

Website 2 is simple in its graphic design and does not have a lot of clutter to it. There are some issues with consistency in labelling which can confuse users, as well as a lack of an easily accessible contact page. The website can be improved to guide users more clearly and to be more streamlined.
