# Usability Evaluation with Users
## DH 150 Assignment 2: Usability Testing by Vicki Truong

#### One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 
Usability testing, or UT, refers to the process of evaluating a product by having representative users test it out in order to improve the usability of a product. 
Usability assesses how easy user interfaces are to use, with some of its metrics being effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, and memorability. Thus, when one performs usability testing, the main goals are to identify any usability problems that may cause frustration, collect empirical data, and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.

In this usability test, I seek to have a user test out the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/search) website. 
The Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website is centered around its catalog, with additional categories at the header (my library, help topics, library, eBook, library calendar/events, Worldcat, and featured items list).
Often times, library websites are used to find books or visual resources, learn about library events, find the library's contact information, or to manage library accounts. 
From my heuristic evaluation, I felt that the catalog and help documentation aspects of the website could be improved for users and I would like to see how other users react to the interface. 
I have asked a user to complete three tasks on the library website: 1) finding a book using keyword (using filter features), 2) finding a book using subject and 3) finding library contact information. 
The usability test is conducted in a residence hall with a minimal setup of a laptop, desk, and chairs, but it is a quiet place. An introduction, informed consent, pre-test questions, 3 tasks, and post-test questions were given to the user and ease of use was measured. 

#### The link to your online survey (UT materials), share the survey with the instructor

#### The link to your pilot UT video (e.g., youtube or google drive)

#### One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
