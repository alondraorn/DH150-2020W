# Interactive Prototype
## DH 150 Assignment 8: High Fidelity Prototype by Vicki Truong

#### A brief description of your project, the purpose and process of this prototyping phase (3-5 sentences) 
The purpose of my project is to provide a streamlined library website that will help improve user experiences. 
I took the feedback from the usability testing, my own heuristic evaluation, and user interviews to build a prototype that attempts to addresses possible issues. 
I broke down the tasks that I wanted to do and meticulously created several artboards and interactions using Invision Studio. Along the way, I would constantly try to put myself in a user perspective, so I made several adjustments as needed. 
I hope the way the website/prototype is layed out encourages users to come back to the library and its website to encourage community participation. 

#### A list of tasks that the interactive prototype of your system supported.  
The overarching main task is searching for a book using the library website. In this prototype, the tasks are presented in a flow-like sequence.  
The tasks embedded within this main task that are found in the prototype are:  
A) Finding the contact information and using the message center.  
B) Log in to your library account.  
C) Using the help center page as a guide for forming search queries.  
D) Search for a harry potter book using the field limit of your option (there is also autosuggestion)  
- i) Refine the search 
- ii) Reserve or bookmark a book.  

E) Manage your account.
- i) Renew books.

#### Description of your decision making of the graphical interface design, including the choice of the color scheme and note if you considered/checked accessibility color contrast.
When coming up with the graphical interface design, I wanted to keep some accessibility features in mind. I chose a relatively orange color scheme, which is more color-blind friendly. The orange is also warm-toned, which I felt would be appropriate for a library website, because libraries are a family-friendly place where people can gather together. I contrasted the shades of orange with white and dark brown text. White can be a little harsh, but I felt that it was the cleanest look and other colors felt a little muddy. The brown text is an alternative to black text, and there are some blue accents of text to provide contrast and to direct attention to specific items of text. I ran audits on a few of the pages and the color contrast aspect of the accessibility audit passed. In the search results for the library prototype, I do use red and green to symbolize whether a book is available or not (red = unavailable, green = available). This is not color-blind friendly, but for most people, green means yes and red means no, so I am drawing on real-world conventions to provide visibility of system status. For those who are not color blind, I bolded the availability status so that one can also focus attention there.

Aside from color, I tried to keep consistent with interactive components throughout the prototype. For user input boxes, they were generally white with a border and some inner shadow to keep in line with other types of website input that can be seen. I also provided some light suggestion text at 50% opacity so users could get a nudge as to what they should type in. Check boxes also had a shadow in them, and follow user customs. When selected, a check mark will appear in them to indicate that a user selected it. I also tried to show the system status with several white popup screens that say "Done" or something similar. I had many buttons to indicate that the user is able to select them, and they were slightly rounded rectangles to distinguish them from the square user input boxes. They were also a bright color and had a slight shadow to provide dimension and give the illusion they are a button as opposed to a flat rectangle, which can be more ambiguous. I also underlined some text to indicate that it was a link meant to be pressed, also to prevent ambiguitiy. I used the underlining when I felt that the buttons were not appropriate or the section was too crowded for buttons. There is one dropdown menu, and the button is a different color for contrast and ease of use. This was a rounded rectangle as opposed to being fully rectangular to distinguish them from normal input boxes. There is also an autosuggestion text box, which has different shadow fills to indicate that it is different from the input text and it is viable to be selected. 

The font is Lato, which is a sans serif font that is generally easy to read. I tried to keep the spacing even and consistent throughout by meticulously measuring spaces. The font does not get too small and is bolded where appropriate to draw more attention.

#### Link to the interactive prototype or embed window that shows the prototype. If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from otherâ€™s feedback and what you have made the changes. 

From some user feedback, they felt that the bookmark and reserve buttons were too crowded, the color scheme could be a little less flat, and the contact pages seemed confusing at the end. I first changed the bookmark and reserve buttons to links. The buttons were clunky and I could achieve a similar effect but in a neater way. The color contrast also was not good, so by changing the buttons to underlined text, users received it better. I also added some accents of blue to break up all the orange and brown, and I feel that the blue goes well with these colors. Finally, I moved the contact slides to the beginning, since the user felt that the end of the search should be the end of the prototype.
