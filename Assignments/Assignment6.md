## DH 150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype by Vicki Truong

#### A brief description of your project.

My project is a library catalog website, seeking to improve upon the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/).  
It can be a hassle to wrestle with library catalogs that are unclear and not the most accommodating to all types of users.   Target users include any user of a library who may want to find a resource, particularly younger children, high school students, higher education students, and adults who do general reading. From the personas, I introduced an elementary school student, a community college student, and a retired grandmother who all go to the library to enhance their knowledge.  
By improving basic functions with the search catalog, users can be more confident using the catalog, incentivizing them to come back and obtain free resources. The library is a great place to foster community and feel peaceful, so the catalog should not hinder a user's experience.  

#### A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.
1. Log into account and bookmark searches (Easily accessible in the top right)
2. Offer search query suggestions, in case of spelling errors (Autocomplete suggestions)
3. Check availability status after making a search (Color-coded availability + larger availability text size) 
4. Be able to compare search results within the same page (Clicking on title will lead to supplementary information sliding out on the same page, not in a new window)

#### A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.

Steps:  
1. User logs in to library account in the top right.
- User clicks on card number input box and enters card number.
- User clicks on phone number or pin input box and enters phone number or pin. 
- Page reloads back to catalog home page.
2. User searches "hairy potter" but "harry potter" comes up as a suggestion underneath.
- User clicks on Harry Potter suggestion (flow to next frame)
3. New screen loads with search results. Color coding and larger availability text can be seen. User selects Harry Potter book with green labelling.
- User clicks on the title.
4. Supplementary information slides down. 
- User clicks on "bookmark search" button that is next to "reserve now" button.
5. "Your search has been bookmarked" with done button pops up.
- User clicks on it for it to go away.
6. Returns to previous screen. 

#### A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.
