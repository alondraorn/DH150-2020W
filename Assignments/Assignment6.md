## DH 150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype by Vicki Truong

#### A brief description of your project.

My project is a library catalog website, seeking to improve upon the [Monterey Park Bruggemeyer Library website](http://library.montereypark.ca.gov/).  
It can be a hassle to wrestle with library catalogs that are unclear and not the most accommodating to all types of users.   Target users include any user of a library who may want to find a resource, particularly younger children, high school students, higher education students, and adults who do general reading. From the personas, I introduced an elementary school student, a community college student, and a retired grandmother who all go to the library to enhance their knowledge.  
By improving basic functions with the search catalog, users can be more confident using the catalog, incentivizing them to come back and obtain free resources. The library is a great place to foster community and feel peaceful, so the catalog should not hinder a user's experience.  

#### A list of tasks that the paper prototype of your system supported.  
1. Log into account and bookmark searches (Easily accessible in the top right)  
2. Offer search query suggestions, in case of spelling errors (Autocomplete suggestions)  
3. Check availability status after making a search (Color-coded availability + larger availability text size)  
4. Be able to compare search results within the same page (Clicking on title will lead to supplementary information sliding out on the same page, not in a new window)  

#### A set of pictures of the prototype in different states, showing it being tested.

#### A description of what you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype.

The tester went through the prototype testing on the found the prototype generally easy to use based on the tasks the tester was supposed to do. The only thing that confused him slightly at first was the loading screen (third slide of prototype) because it was not interactive like the previous slides had seemed. I don't think this was a big problem to fix because he figured it out eventually, and that slide was not really meant to be interacted with. For the online wireframe, I wish that there was a way to add depth to things so that I could make buttons or clickable links easier to distinguish from plain text. There are little things that could improve the ease with which users interact with the prototype, but this is just chalked up to the limitations of the Invision App. The Invision App was not my favorite thing to use, since the keyboard shortcuts were a bit fickle, and I wasn't able to customize things the way I wanted to, so I would maybe consider a different place to do prototypes.
